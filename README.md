# NOAA_climate_BigQuery_example
An example created originally for UCSD course ECE228. This version is from Spring 2019. 

Note that the codes were designed to run on a Docker container set up only for the course (now obsolete).
I hope to add the requirements.txt at a later date (today 7/14/2021).

Please note these codes use BaseMap package, which has some incompatibilities. I chose it because it was the only package I found to accomplish this type of geographic plotting.
Comments appreciated.
